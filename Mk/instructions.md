Hi, welcome to this adventure!!
To finish the game successfully, you have to get Gru alive from beginning to end, be careful of the life status and don't forget to use the basic commands "look" to get a description of your surrounding and "inventory" to see the objects that you carry with you, "health" to see the health status and "help" to see the instructions again.
